### Hardware Compatibility
Nexalis Agent can be deployed on:
- A physical server (x86 or ARM for Linux; 32 bits or 64 bits for Windows)
- A Virtual Machine (VM) on a shared server

---

### Deployment options
- **Linux build (standalone executable)** — Compatible with most mainstream Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, AlmaLinux, and others). Requires the following standard utilities: `procps`, `jq`, `unzip`, `tar` and `systemd`. Designed for lightweight and flexible deployments.
- **Docker (containerized)** — Runs anywhere Docker is available; simplest operational footprint.
- **Windows**  — Runs on >= Windows 7

---

### Server specifications
- A minimum hardware specification of 2 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM is recommended to run the Nexalis Agent. This specification can handle 10000 events per second. 
- 4 vCPU and 16GB of RAM can handle 35000 events per second.
- Actual requirements may vary depending on tag volume, data frequency, and other site-specific factors, but this baseline is sufficient for large-scale deployments.

### Disk space specifications

The Nexalis Agent reserves disk space at startup to avoid runtime issues caused by misconfigured sizes. This ensures that both buffering and logs have dedicated space and cannot unexpectedly fill the system disk.

#### 1) Buffering size
The Agent buffers data locally whenever the connection to Nexalis Cloud is interrupted.  

- **Minimum recommended size:** 5 GB  
- **Sizing formula:**  
  ```
  disk space (GB) ≈ event_rate (events/s) × retention_time (s) × 50 bytes / 1e9
  ```
  - Uses ~50 bytes per compressed event (includes a safety margin).  
  - Example: for 1,000 events/s with 7 days retention → ~30.24 GB required.  

This buffer guarantees reliable backfill once the cloud connection is restored.

#### 2) Log size
Each **industrial connector** and the **gRPC_kafka** component has configurable log size parameters (rotation, maximum file size, and retention).  
Disk space for these logs is also reserved at Nexalis Agent startup to prevent disk exhaustion due to incorrect settings.

### Network, time, DNS
- **Ports:** Cloud uplink defaults to **9092/TCP**; connectors may use **62541 (OPC UA)**, **502 (Modbus)**, **20000 (DNP3)**; **53 (DNS)**. Ensure required port openings are allowed.
- **Time sync:** Enable **NTP** to ensure accurate timestamps.
- **DNS:** Ensure resolvers (e.g., enterprise DNS or 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4) are set so Nexalis Agent can reach cloud endpoints.

---

### Bandwidth requirements

The Nexalis Agent is designed to operate with **minimal network bandwidth**.  

- **Maximum bandwidth requirement:** approximately **20 kilobits per second**.  
- This corresponds to the transmission of around **1,000 events per second**.  

Such efficiency ensures scalable data handling even in environments with **constrained connectivity**.

### Connection status semantics

The Nexalis Agent industiral connectors publish **connection status messages** every 10 seconds; gRPC_kafka forwards it to the cloud. Interpretation:

| Local (to data source) | Link with Nexalis Cloud | Result in Nexalis Cloud                                                |
|---|---|---|
| TRUE  | TRUE  | Status messages received; **value = 1** (healthy). |
| TRUE  | FALSE | No status messages received; **value = 1**; data is buffered by Agent. |
| FALSE | TRUE  | Status messages received; **value = 0**; data needs to be backfilled if possible. |
| FALSE | FALSE | No status messages received; **value = 0**; data needs to be backfilled if possible. |

Example of an OPC UA connection status message:
```json
{ 
  "siteName": "TEST_SITE1", 
  "deviceID": "12345", 
  "deviceModel": "./device_models/opcua_device.json",
  "protocol": "opcua",
  "dataPoint": "nexalisConnectionStatus",
  "value": 1, 
  "tsConnector": 1234567890123, 
  "triggerType": "cyclic-10"
} 
```
