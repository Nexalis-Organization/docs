Welcome to the **Nexalis Agent** documentation. This guide explains how to install and configure **Nexalis Agent**. It is designed for technical users (e.g., SCADA engineers) who need to extract data from industrial systems.

## What Nexalis Agent does

- Nexalis Agent **extracts raw data** from on-premise or remote industrial assets and **loads** it to Nexalis Cloud in **real time**. **Industrial connectors (e.g., OPC UA, Modbus, etc.) extract data from assets**, and gRPC_kafka **loads this raw data securely into Nexalis Cloud**. This is what we describe as mirroring data.    
- In addition to forwarding raw data streams, gRPC_kafka **computes averaged data** (e.g., 5-minute averages) before loading.
- The Agent also provides **local buffering**: if the connection to the cloud is interrupted, data is stored on disk. Once connectivity is restored, the Agent **automatically backfills buffered data, ensuring no information is lost**.

## Example of a Nexalis Agent setup 
1 DNP3 connector and 2 Modbus connectors (TCP and RTU) and a cloud data source.
