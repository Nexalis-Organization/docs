# Delta Sharing — Databricks‑to‑Databricks Protocol

The **Databricks‑to‑Databricks Delta Sharing protocol** enables seamless sharing of datasets between Nexalis and your own Databricks workspace.

---

## Recipient Sharing Identifier

To configure Delta Sharing, you need to provide Nexalis with your **recipient sharing identifier**.  
This identifier is unique to your Databricks workspace and has the format:

```text
<cloud>:<region>:<recipient-UUID>

# Example:
aws:us-east-1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## How to find your identifier

1. In your Databricks workspace, click **Catalog**.  
2. At the top of the Catalog pane, click the **Gear icon** and select **Delta Sharing** (Alternatively, from the **Quick access** page, click **Delta Sharing >**).
4. On the **Shared with me** tab, click your Databricks sharing organization name in the upper right.  
5. Select **Copy sharing identifier**.

Once obtained, send this identifier to your **Nexalis account manager** or support contact so Nexalis can configure sharing for your environment.

⚠️ **Recommendation:** To avoid egress costs, use the **same region** as the Nexalis Databricks environment.

---

## After setup

After Nexalis completes the configuration, you will see the shared tables directly in your Databricks workspace:

- `gold_<user_name>_avg_std`  
- `gold_<user_name>_hf_std`  

From there, you can use the full Databricks ecosystem to build analytics, pipelines, and AI workloads.
