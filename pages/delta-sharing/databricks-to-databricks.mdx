# Delta Sharing Databricks-to-Databricks protocol

To enable Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing, you will need to provide Nexalis with your recipient sharing identifier. This identifier is unique to your Databricks workspace and has the following format (&lt;cloud&gt;:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;recipient-UUID&gt;):

aws:us-east-1:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

You can find this identifier in your Databricks workspace by following these steps:

In your Databricks workspace, click    Catalog.

At the top of the Catalog pane, click the   gear icon and select Delta Sharing.

Alternatively, from the Quick access page, click the Delta Sharing > button.

On the “Shared with me” tab, click your Databricks sharing organization name in the upper right, and select Copy sharing identifier.

Once obtained, please send this identifier to your Nexalis account manager or support contact so that Nexalis can configure sharing for your environment.

Note: To avoid egress costs, we recommend using the same region as the Nexalis Databricks environment.

After Nexalis completes the setup, you will see the shared tables (gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_avg_std and gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_hf_std) directly inside your Databricks workspace. From it, you can use anything offered by Databricks to build your data and AI workloads.
