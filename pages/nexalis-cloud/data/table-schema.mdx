The **Nexalis Table Schema** defines how the data within the tables is structured into columns.

## Column Groups

Most columns are shared across both tables `avg_std` and `hf_std`, but there are some differences. 
**Presence** below is indicated neutrally as `both`, `avg_std`, or `hf_std`.

### Device metadata
- **siteName** — *Presence:* `both`; site where the device is located  
- **deviceModel** — *Presence:* `both`; manufacturer and model  
- **deviceID** — *Presence:* `both`; unique identifier of the device  
- **subDeviceID** — *Presence:* `both`; distinguishes devices when connected via proxy/gateway  
- **assetName** — *Presence:* `both`; concatenation of deviceID + subDeviceID  
- **protocol** — *Presence:* `both`; communication protocol used  

### Standardization fields
- **assetType** — *Presence:* `both`; standardized device type (e.g., Solar inverter, Storage inverter, Meteo station, Meter, Wind turbine, etc.)
- **logicalNode** — *Presence:* `both`; standardized function type (e.g., MMDC: DC Measurements)
- **dataObject** — *Presence:* `both`; standardized tag (e.g., PhV: phase voltage)
- **subDataObject** — *Presence:* `both`; finer breakdown (e.g., phsA: phase A)
- **engUnits** — *Presence:* `both`; standardized engineering units
- **measurementType** — *Presence:* `both`; Analog type vs Discrete type

> These fields reference the **Nexalis Ontology Data Model** which is an ontology that provides the standardized vocabulary for classification (asset types, logical nodes, data objects, etc.). It is **provided as a template and is customizable by users** to match their operational context. 
It provides a standardized ontology data model for accessing and analyzing industrial data across different asset types.

### Data values
- **dataPoint** — *Presence:* `both`; device‑specific identifier (e.g., Modbus register, OPC UA tag)  
- **value** — *Presence:* `both`;  
  - in `avg_std`: averaged value per interval  
  - in `hf_std`: raw high‑frequency reading  
- **min, max, count** — *Presence:* `avg_std`; aggregated statistics for each X‑minute interval  
- **description** — *Presence:* `both`; manufacturer‑provided description  
- **qualitySource** — *Presence:* `both`; quality indicator  
- **triggerType** — *Presence:* `both`; Nexalis Agent configuration for when to send data  
- **metaData** — *Presence:* `both`; additional protocol parameters (settings, buffering info)  

### Timestamps
- **tsConnector** — *Presence:* `both`; epoch (ms) when collected  
- **dtConnector** — *Presence:* `both`; human‑readable equivalent  
- **tsReception** — *Presence:* `both`; when sent to cloud  
- **tsSource** — *Presence:* `both`; timestamp directly from device  

### Unique identifier
- **uniqueTagID** — *Presence:* `both`; concatenation of key fields → globally unique datapoint ID

## Notes

- **Unstandardized tags** → standardization columns remain empty (`assetType`, `logicalNode`, `dataObject`, `subDataObject`, `engUnits`, `measurementType`).  
- **Filter standardized only** → use query: `dataObject != null`.  
- **`gold_<user_name>_avg_std`** → interval configurable per‑agent. Best for trend analysis but does not include booleans/enumerations.  
- **`gold_<user_name>_hf_std`** → includes booleans/enumerations. Best for real‑time monitoring and troubleshooting.
