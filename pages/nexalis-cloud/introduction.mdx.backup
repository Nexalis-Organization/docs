# Nexalis Cloud

Welcome to **Nexalis Cloud** documentation. This guide explains how to access and consume industrial data from the Nexalis platform. Whether you're a data engineer building pipelines, an analyst creating dashboards, or a developer integrating real-time data into applications, Nexalis Cloud provides flexible access patterns to fit your workflow.

## Two Ways to Access Your Data

Nexalis Cloud offers two complementary data access methods, each optimized for different use cases:

### 1. Real-Time API

A high-performance **HTTP API** for querying time-series data in real time. Powered by Warp10, this API is designed for:

- **Real-time applications** requiring sub-second response times
- **Custom time-range queries** with advanced filtering and aggregations
- **Edge analytics** and operational dashboards
- **Event-driven architectures** and alerting systems

Perfect for applications that need the latest sensor readings or want to query historical data with precise time windows.

### 2. Lakehouse Shortcuts

**Direct access to Delta Lake tables** through native cloud storage shortcuts. Your data is stored as Delta tables in cloud object storage (AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, or GCP Cloud Storage), and you can access it natively through:

#### Supported Platforms

- **Databricks** — Delta Sharing protocol or external tables
- **Microsoft Fabric** — OneLake shortcuts and external data shares
- **Snowflake** — External tables via cloud storage integration
- **AWS** — Direct S3 access with Athena, Glue, EMR
- **Azure** — Data Lake access with Synapse, HDInsight
- **GCP** — Cloud Storage access with BigQuery, Dataproc

This approach provides:
- **Zero data replication** — Data stays in place, you query it directly
- **Native integration** with your existing data platform
- **Cost efficiency** — No compute costs from Nexalis, pay only cloud storage egress
- **Full Delta Lake features** — Time travel, ACID transactions, schema evolution

## Accessing data from Nexalis Cloud — at a glance

You have **three options** for accessing and analyzing your data. Each addresses different needs for analytics, sharing, and BI:

- **User-managed Databricks** — for advanced analytics, AI/ML, and fully customized pipelines.  
- **Delta Sharing (open protocol)** — for flexible cross‑organization data sharing and replication across different tools.  
- **Nexalis‑provided SQL Warehouse** — for quick connections with BI/reporting tools such as Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and Grafana.

### What this guide covers

- **An overview of each access option**, including best use cases and cost considerations.  
- **A description of the data tables** you will receive (`gold_<org_name>_avg_std` and `gold_<org_name>_hf_std`).
- **How to connect via Delta Sharing Databricks‑to‑Databricks**
- **How to connect via Delta Sharing open protocol**
- **How to connect to the Nexalis Databricks SQL Warehouse for BI tools and apps**.
- **Practical examples** Python/Spark code examples, guide to connect the data to Excel, Power BI, and more.

By the end, you’ll know which option best fits your use case, how to configure access securely, and how to start querying data for analytics.

## Options comparison (quick view)

| **Option to access the data** | **Best For** | **Example Use Cases** |
|---|---|---|
| **#1 – User-managed Databricks** | **Data & AI workloads** | Custom & advanced analytics, AI/ML models, automated jobs, streaming data, dashboard creation, controlled access |
| **#2 – Delta Sharing** | **Cross‑org data sharing** | Real‑time applications, scheduled reporting, multi‑tenant data replication |
| **#3 – Nexalis‑provided SQL Warehouse** | **Analytics & BI tools** | Power BI, Excel, Grafana dashboards, ad‑hoc analysis |

## Options details

| **Option to access the data** | **Technology** | **Cost Profile** | **Data Handling** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#1 – User‑managed Databricks** | **Delta Sharing (Databricks‑to‑Databricks protocol)** | Client pays for **Databricks compute**; **egress cost*** | Data is **accessed directly** in client’s Databricks account | Benefit from the **full range of Databricks data and AI capabilities**. |
| **#2 – Delta Sharing** | **Open sharing protocol** (REST; works with Spark connector and Python library) | **Egress cost*** | Data is **downloaded & replicated** | **Best for data pipelines, replication, or sharing with external systems** |
| **#3 – Nexalis‑provided SQL Warehouse** | **JDBC/ODBC driver**, REST API, Python/Java client, etc. | **Egress costs***; **compute costs** are passed‑through and billed on usage | Data is **queried in place** | **Optimized for BI/reporting; integrates easily** |
> _\*Egress cost is charged when data leaves the Nexalis Cloud region. Costs are passed‑through and billed on usage.*_

---

## Summary

- **Choose User-managed Databricks** if you are building custom data pipelines, advanced analytics, or AI/ML models on top of the Nexalis Platform.  
- **Choose Delta Sharing (open protocol)** if you need to replicate data across organizations, integrate with external systems, or feed it into custom pipelines outside of Databricks.  
- **Choose Nexalis-provided SQL Warehouse** if your main goal is creating BI dashboards or running ad-hoc queries with tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Grafana.
