# Nexalis Cloud

Welcome to **Nexalis Cloud** documentation. This guide explains how to access and consume industrial data from the Nexalis Platform. Whether you're a data engineer building pipelines, an analyst creating dashboards, or a developer integrating real-time data into applications, Nexalis Cloud provides flexible access patterns to fit your workflow.

## Two Ways to Access Your Data

Nexalis Cloud offers two complementary data access methods, each optimized for different use cases:

### 1. Real-Time API

A high-performance **HTTP API** for querying time-series data in real time. This API is designed for:

- **Real-time applications** requiring sub-second response times
- **Custom calculation** with advanced time-series functions (see https://www.warp10.io/doc/reference)
- **Analytics** and operational dashboards
- **Event-driven architectures** and alerting systems

Perfect for applications that need the latest sensor readings or want to query historical data with custom needs.

### 2. Lakehouse Sharing

**Read-only access to your data** through native lakehouse sharing protocols. Nexalis deploys your data on the lakehouse platform and cloud region that matches your infrastructure — whether that's **Databricks**, **Snowflake**, or **Microsoft Fabric** on **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**. You connect using native data sharing from your preferred lakehouse platform:

#### Three Native Connection Options

- **Databricks-to-Databricks** — Delta Sharing protocol for read-only table access
- **Fabric-to-Fabric** — OneLake shortcuts and external data shares
- **Snowflake-to-Snowflake** — Native data sharing with secure views

Nexalis matches your specific combination of cloud provider, lakehouse platform, and region to ensure seamless, cost-effective data sharing with zero egress fees.

#### Benefits

- **Zero data replication** — Data stays in Nexalis lakehouse, you query it directly
- **Native integration** — Works seamlessly with your existing lakehouse platform
- **Optimized deployment** — Data hosted in the same cloud provider and region as your infrastructure
- **Cost efficiency** — Zero cloud egress fees, pay only for your own lakehouse service usage
- **Read-only security** — Your access is secure and restricted to approved tables
- **Always up-to-date & maintained** — Nexalis continuously refreshes and maintains the shared tables (corrections, schema evolution), so consumers always query trusted data.

## Choosing Your Access Method

| **Access Method** | **Best For** | **Latency** | **Platforms** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real-Time API** | Operational dashboards, real-time apps, custom queries | Sub-second to seconds | Any (HTTP/JSON) |
| **Lakehouse Sharing** | Analytics, ML/AI, BI tools, data warehouses | Minutes (table snapshots) | Databricks, Fabric, Snowflake |

### When to Use Real-Time API

✅ Historical data access  
✅ Building real-time monitoring dashboards  
✅ Need the absolute latest sensor readings  
✅ Custom time-series calculations (e.g., "5-minute averages")  
✅ Integration with alerting, notification and work order management systems  
✅ Low-latency analytics  

### When to Use Lakehouse Sharing

✅ Running SQL analytics and BI queries  
✅ Training machine learning / AI models  
✅ Building batch data pipelines  
✅ Creating historical trend analysis  
✅ Already using Databricks, Fabric, or Snowflake  
✅ Need native lakehouse integration with zero data replication  

**Pro Tip:** Many users use both! The Real-Time API powers operational dashboards while lakehouse sharing feeds analytical workloads and ML pipelines.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Access Method(s)

- For real-time time-series API → [Real-Time API Guide](./real-time-api)
- For Databricks lakehouse → [Databricks-to-Databricks Setup](./delta-sharing/databricks-to-databricks)
- For Microsoft Fabric lakehouse → [Fabric-to-Fabric Setup](./delta-sharing/fabric-to-fabric)
- For Snowflake lakehouse → Coming soon. In the meantime, please consult: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-sharing-intro

(For the lakehouse methods, review the [Data Tables documentation](./lakehouse-data-sharing/data-structure/data-tables) to understand the schema and structure of your tables.

### Step 2: Request Access

Contact your Nexalis account manager or email [contact@nexalis.io](mailto:contact@nexalis.io) with:
- Your preferred access method(s)
- Your lakehouse platform (Databricks, Fabric, or Snowflake)
- Your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and preferred region
- Azure Tenant ID (for Fabric), Databricks Workspace details, or Snowflake Account ID

## Cloud-Native Architecture

Nexalis Cloud is built on modern cloud-native principles:

- **Flexible deployment** — We deploy on the cloud provider, lakehouse platform, and region that matches your infrastructure
- **Three lakehouse platforms** — Support for Databricks, Microsoft Fabric, and Snowflake
- **Native sharing protocols** — Connect using your lakehouse platform's native capabilities
- **Cost-optimized** — Minimize egress fees by matching your cloud provider and region
- **Scalable** — Automatically handles thousands of devices and millions of data points
- **Secure** — Encryption in transit and at rest, read-only access control
