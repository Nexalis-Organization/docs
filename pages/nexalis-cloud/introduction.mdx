Welcome to the **Nexalis Cloud API Access** documentation. This guide explains how to connect and consume industrial data from **Nexalis Cloud**. It is designed for users (data engineers, developers, analysts, dashboard creators, etc.) who want to integrate Nexalis data into their tools and workflows.

## Accessing data from Nexalis Cloud — at a glance

You have **three options** for accessing and analyzing your data. Each addresses different needs for analytics, sharing, and BI:

- **User-managed Databricks** — for advanced analytics, AI/ML, and fully customized pipelines.  
- **Delta Sharing (open protocol)** — for flexible cross‑organization data sharing and replication across different tools.  
- **Nexalis‑provided SQL Warehouse** — for quick connections with BI/reporting tools such as Power BI, Tableau, Excel, and Grafana.

### What this guide covers

- **An overview of each access option**, including best use cases and cost considerations.  
- **A description of the data tables** you will receive (`gold_<user_name>_avg_std` and `gold_<user_name>_hf_std`).
- **How to connect via Delta Sharing Databricks‑to‑Databricks**
- **How to connect via Delta Sharing open protocol**
- **How to connect to the Nexalis Databricks SQL Warehouse for BI tools and apps**.
- **Practical examples** Python/Spark code examples, guide to connect the data to Excel, Power BI, and more.

By the end, you’ll know which option best fits your use case, how to configure access securely, and how to start querying data for analytics.

## Options details

| **Option to access the data** | **Technology** | **Cost Profile** | **Data Handling** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#1 – User‑managed Databricks** | **Delta Sharing (Databricks‑to‑Databricks protocol)** | Client pays for **Databricks compute**; **egress cost*** | Data is **accessed directly** in client’s Databricks account | Benefit from the **full range of Databricks data and AI capabilities**. |
| **#2 – Delta Sharing** | **Open sharing protocol** (REST; works with Spark connector and Python library) | **Egress cost*** | Data is **downloaded & replicated** | **Best for data pipelines, replication, or sharing with external systems** |
| **#3 – Nexalis‑provided SQL Warehouse** | **JDBC/ODBC driver**, REST API, Python/Java client, etc. | **Egress costs***; **compute costs** are passed‑through and billed on usage | Data is **queried in place** | **Optimized for BI/reporting; integrates easily** |
> _\*Egress cost is charged when data leaves the Nexalis Cloud region. Costs are passed‑through and billed on usage.*_

## Summary

- **Choose User-managed Databricks** if you are building custom data pipelines, advanced analytics, or AI/ML models on top of the Nexalis Platform.  
- **Choose Delta Sharing (open protocol)** if you need to replicate data across organizations, integrate with external systems, or feed it into custom pipelines outside of Databricks.  
- **Choose Nexalis-provided SQL Warehouse** if your main goal is creating BI dashboards or running ad-hoc queries with tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Grafana.
