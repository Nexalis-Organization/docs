## Data tables you will receive

You will be provisioned access to two tables:

- **`gold_<user_name>_avg_std`** — Contains raw and standardized data, **aggregated in X-minute intervals** (X-minute interval is a parameter of the Nexalis Agent). Includes minimum, maximum, count and average values. Does not include discrete tags.  
- **`gold_<user_name>_hf_std`** — Contains raw and standardized **high‑frequency** data (per‑second). Includes discrete tags (e.g., booleans and enumerations for alarms and codes) 

> Transformation adds standardized columns for cross-vendor comparison and values are scaled to the data model units.  

> _Tip: To filter only standardized tags, use a condition like `dataObject != null` in your queries._
