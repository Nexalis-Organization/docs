## 🏠 Nexalis Agent
The **Nexalis Agent** is the edge software that ensures reliable, real-time data flow from on-premise and remote assets to the cloud.

- **Flexible Deployment**: Available on Linux, Docker, or Windows; VM, on-prem hardware, or deployed remotely in the cloud.  
- **Data Collection**: Connects to industrial devices with protocols such as Modbus, OPC UA, DNP3, OPC XML DA, etc.
- **Automated Data Flow**: Configure automated data streaming by time intervals, value changes, or percentage changes, with built-in support to compute data averages (e.g., 5-minute averages).  
- **Real-Time**: Streams industrial data in real time for immediate insights.  
- **Reliability**: On-disk buffering prevents data loss during outages or when connectivity to the cloud is interrupted.
- **Rapid Onboarding**: Connect your data to the cloud in minutes with no complex integration thanks to our unique **EL(T) mechanism — Extract, Load, (Transform) —**; **Extracts** data from industrial systems, **Loads** it into **Nexalis Cloud**, and only then applies data **Transformations** as needed.
