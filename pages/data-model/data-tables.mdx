# Data Tables

Customers receive access to 2 tables:

gold_&lt;user-name&gt;_avg_std: Contains raw and standardized data, aggregated in X-minute intervals from all different sites with a Nexalis Agent running (X-minute interval is a parameter of the Nexalis Agent). Includes minimum, maximum, count and average values. Note: Boolean values are included in this table.

gold_&lt;user-name&gt;_hf_std: Contains raw and standardized data collected with high-frequency (second-level data) from all different sites with a Nexalis Agent running. This table includes data points not being standardized. The transformation adds standardized columns for easier cross-vendor comparison. Values have been scaled to comply with the Nexalis data model units.
