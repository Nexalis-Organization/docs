# Data Exploration

The Nexalis Data Model provides the list of standardized tags for different asset types.

When exploring Nexalis data, you will have access to two core standardized tables: gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_avg_std and gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_hf_std. While both tables contain raw and standardized device data, they differ in terms of frequency, aggregation, and whether discrete tags (such as booleans or enumerations) are included.

The table below provides a quick comparison to help you understand which dataset best fits your analysis needs:

Column Groups

Most columns are shared across both tables, but there are key differences. The list below groups columns by category, shows where each is present, and includes a short description:

Device Metadata (✅ Both tables)

siteName: site where the device is located

deviceModel: manufacturer and model of the device

deviceID: unique identifier of the device (Nexalis data source)

subDeviceID: distinguishes devices when connected via proxy/gateway

assetName: concatenation of deviceID and subDeviceID for unique identification

protocol: communication protocol used to read data from the device

Standardization Fields (✅ Both tables; empty if tag not standardized)

assetType: standardized type of device (e.g., inverter, meter, weather station)

logicalNode: standardized type of function (e.g., DC Measurements)

dataObject: standardized tag for the logical node (e.g., phase voltage)

subDataObject: finer breakdown of the dataObject (e.g., phase A)

engUnits: standardized engineering units of the value

measurementType: standardized description of the tag (Analog vs Discrete)

Data Values

dataPoint — ✅ Both tables

device-specific identifier for the value (e.g., register address for Modbus, tag name for OPC UA, etc.)

value — ✅ Both tables

gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_avg_std: X-minute average (per-agent configurable interval)

gold_&lt;user-name&gt;_hf_std: raw, high-frequency reading

min, max, count — ✅ Only in gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_avg_std

aggregated statistics for each X-minute interval

description — ✅ Both tables

manufacturer-provided description of the datapoint

qualitySource — ✅ Both tables

quality indicator of the datapoint

triggerType: Nexalis Agent configuration for when to send reading to the cloud

metaData — ✅ Both tables

additional parameters (protocol settings, buffering info)

Timestamps (✅ Both tables)

tsConnector: epoch timestamp (ms) when data was collected by the Agent

dtConnector: human-readable datetime equivalent of tsConnector

tsReception: epoch timestamp (ms) when Agent sent data to the cloud

tsSource: epoch timestamp (ms) directly from the device

Unique Identifier (✅ Both tables)

uniqueTagID: concatenation of key fields to create a globally unique datapoint ID

Note regarding both tables:

If a tag is not standardized, the standardization columns (assetType, logicalNode, dataObject, subDataObject, engUnits and measurementType) will be empty.

To return only standardized tags, filter with: "dataObject != null" in your query.

Note regarding gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_avg_std:

The X-minute interval is configurable per-agent in the Nexalis Agent settings. Different sites may therefore report aggregated values at different intervals, depending on how their agents are configured. We recommend the Nexalis users configure this parameter with the same value for consistency across sites.

Discrete tags (e.g., booleans and enumerations for alarms and codes) are not included in gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_avg_std. You can only find them in gold_&lt;user-name&gt;_hf_std table since they are not averaged.

Note regarding gold_&lt;user-name&gt;_hf_std:

Discrete tags (e.g., booleans and enumerations for alarms and codes) are included in gold_&lt;user_name&gt;_hf_std.
